Problem Statement:
    
I have to program a Python script to perform sentiment analysis of the Twitter activity of news outlets - BBC, CBS, CNN, Fox, and New York times - and present findings visually.

![image.png](attachment:image.png)

![TweetPolarity_NewsOutlet.png](attachment:TweetPolarity_NewsOutlet.png)
![TweetPolarity_TweetsAgo.png](attachment:TweetPolarity_TweetsAgo.png)

Step 1 : I import the libraries and packages (a.k.a tools of trade!) for my analysis.


```python
# Import dependencies

import tweepy
import json
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

from datetime import date
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns


# Twitter API Keys

consumer_key = "aoCDolf5adnIaw8yzMmxy1EH4"
consumer_secret = "LBmKVfpZoqOT6YVsWcjXa1ZyXjZ2i8hu4LhbnvVOBwwvu6hjF8"
access_token = "161980186-vjLsfGo6lCe92ttUonuaTxUAOsy9J5eDDOjH2sjf"
access_token_secret = "M1XVIyVrdx6nVI8ty59O4zbSEx6mkEX5guhF1yeT9wjl2"

# Import and Initialize Sentiment Analyzer

from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
```

Step 2 : I set up tweepy authetication to take my API keys and grant me authorization to use API results.


```python
# Setup Tweepy API Authentication

auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
api = tweepy.API(auth, parser=tweepy.parsers.JSONParser())
```

Step 3: I assign and define variables - hold target accounts, empty list to hold sentiments.


```python
# Define target accounts for BBC, CBS, CNN, Fox, and New York times

target_user = ["BBCWorld","CBSNews","CNN","FoxNews","nytimes"]
```


```python
# Lists to hold sentiments

sentiments = []
```

Step 4: I define the logic to retrieve tweets and analyze their sentiments. Also, the first 100 tweets for each target account is printed to the console. 


```python
# Grab 100 tweets for each target user and loop through it 

for target in target_user:
    
    at_target = "@" + target
    public_tweets = api.user_timeline(at_target, count=100, result_type="recent")
    counter = 1
    
    for tweet in public_tweets:
        
        # Run Vader Analysis on each tweet
        
        results = analyzer.polarity_scores(tweet["text"])
        compound = results["compound"]
        pos = results["pos"]
        neu = results["neu"]
        neg = results["neg"]

        # Add sentiments for each tweet into a list
        
        sentiments.append({"Date": tweet["created_at"], 
                           "News_Source":target,
                           "Compound": compound,
                           "Positive": pos,
                           "Negative": neu,
                           "Neutral": neg,
                           "Tweets_Ago": counter,
                           "Tweet":tweet["text"]})
        
        
        Tweet_Text = tweet["text"]
        
        # Print Tweet Text and increment the counter 
        
        print(f"Tweet {counter} for {target}: {Tweet_Text} \n")
        
        counter = counter + 1

```

Step 5: I create dataframes to hold the data extracted from the logic above, and clean the data.


```python
# Convert sentiments to DataFrame

sentiments_pd = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(sentiments)

# Replace the Twitter Handles with identifiable news outlets

sentiments_pd.News_Source = sentiments_pd.News_Source.replace({"BBCWorld":"BBC",
                                                               "CNN": "CNN",
                                                               "FoxNews":"Fox",
                                                               "nytimes" :"New_York_Times",
                                                               "CBSNews":"CBS"})
# Display the 5 outlets to validate

sentiments_pd["News_Source"].value_counts()
```




    CNN               100
    Fox               100
    CBS               100
    BBC               100
    New_York_Times    100
    Name: News_Source, dtype: int64




```python
# Rearrange the dataframe and define it in a new dataframe

sentiments_pd_clean = sentiments_pd[["News_Source","Tweet","Date","Compound","Positive","Neutral","Negative","Tweets_Ago"]]

sentiments_pd_clean.info()
```

    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    RangeIndex: 500 entries, 0 to 499
    Data columns (total 8 columns):
    News_Source    500 non-null object

    dtypes: float64(4), int64(1), object(3)
    memory usage: 31.3+ KB
    

Step 5: I use seaborn libraries -lmplot, barplot - to visualize the results.


```python
# Define the lmplot structure

sns.set()

sns.set_context("notebook")

    
sns_plot1 = sns.lmplot( x="Tweets_Ago", y="Compound", data = sentiments_pd_clean,fit_reg=False,

                                                         BBC="#ed0dd9",New_York_Times="#fac205" ))

Today_Date = str(date.today())


# Label the plot and set the axes limit

Plot_Title = f"Sentiment Analysis of Media Tweets: {Today_Date}"

plt.title(Plot_Title)

plt.ylabel("Tweet Polarity")
plt.xlabel("Tweets Ago")

plt.xlim(105,-5)
plt.ylim(-1.2, 1.2)

plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc=2, borderaxespad=0)

# Save the image and display

plt.show(sns_plot1)

```python
# Display the sentiments dataframe grouped by News_Source

sentiments_pd_grouped = sentiments_pd_clean.groupby(["News_Source"],as_index=False).mean()

sentiments_pd_grouped[["News_Source","Compound","Positive","Neutral","Negative"]]
